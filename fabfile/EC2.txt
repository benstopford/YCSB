This file describes how to use this altered version of YCSB to run on Amazon EC2

Setup
* This install currently only works for bash compatible systems as it uses the EC2 command line api (needs porting to the python one)
* Create an amazon AWS Account. Create this and create yourself a .pem file which will provide your private key
* Install the EC2 CLI (note this is the new one) http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
* Place the .pem file in the YCSB root directory
* Edit fabric/conf/hosts.py to include the path to your .pem file
* Follow the instructions in FABRIC.txt to install fabric

Execution
---------------
in the YCSB root dir run

fab ec2_up                                        #brings up all the instances you need, a ycsb cluster and the relevant DB

fab ec2_down                                      #terminates all instances permanently

fab ycsb_deploy                                   #deploys YCSB to the cluster

fab ycsb_start_db_man:db=mongodb	              #will start managment processes if any are configured

fab ycsb_start_db:db=mongodb                      #runs commands to start the database if needed

fab ycsb_inittables:db=cassandra                  #initialises the database tables for the first time

fab ycsb_load:db=cassandra                        #loads data into casssandra

fab ycsb_run:db=cassandra,workload=B              #run the ycsb benchmark

fab ycsb_status:db=cassandra                      #quick look at what's going on

fab ycsb_get:db=casssandra,do=True                #download logs (take the do=True to peak at the filenames)
