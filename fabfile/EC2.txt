This file describes how to use this altered version of YCSB to run on Amazon EC2

Setup
* This install currently only works for bash compatible systems as it uses the EC2 command line api (needs porting to the python one)
* Create an amazon AWS Account. Create this and create yourself a .pem file which will provide your private key
* Install the EC2 CLI (note this is the new one) http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
* Place the .pem file in the YCSB root directory
* Edit fabric/conf/hosts.py to include the path to your .pem file
* Follow the instructions in FABRIC.txt to install fabric

Execution
---------------
in the YCSB root dir run

fab -f fabric/fabfile ec2_up                                        #brings up all the instances you need, a ycsb cluster and the relevant DB

fab -f fabric/fabfile ec2_down                                      #terminates all instances permanently

fab -f fabric/fabfile ycsb_deploy                                   #deploys YCSB to the cluster

fab -f fabric/fabfile ycsb_load:db=cassandra                        #loads data into casssandra

fab -f fabric/fabfile ycsb_run:db=cassandra,workload=B              #run the ycsb benchmark
