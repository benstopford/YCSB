fab -f fabric/fabfile ec2_up                                        #brings up all the instances you need, a ycsb cluster and the relevant DB

fab -f fabric/fabfile ec2_down                                      #terminates all instances permanently

fab -f fabric/fabfile ycsb_deploy                                   #deploys YCSB to the cluster

fab -f fabric/fabfile ycsb_load:db=cassandra                        #loads data into casssandra

fab -f fabric/fabfile ycsb_run:db=cassandra,workload=B              #run the ycsb benchmark
